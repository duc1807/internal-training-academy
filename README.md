## Notes and comments
- Development of this application is strongly reliant on `XAMPP`. For this reason, these configurations defined in [`db.php`](utils/db.php) and [`connect.php`](utils/connect.php) are defined exclusively for `PHPMyAdmin`.
- The latest version of `XAMPP` contains `MariaDB` instead of `MySQL`. Follow [this instruction](https://odan.github.io/2017/08/13/xampp-replacing-mariadb-with-mysql.html) to get MySQL back.

### Project File Structure
 Regarding *CRUD* operations: controllers for *Create*, *Update* and *Remove* operations are in [`controllers` folder](./controllers).
